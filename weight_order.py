"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: 

"100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:

180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

Notes
it may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers
